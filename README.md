## Overview

The "cub3d" project, inspired by the classic game "Wolfenstein 3D", is an exciting venture into the world of graphics programming. Students embark on the journey of creating a "ray-casting" engine, replicating the style of the aforementioned game. The task involves creating a dynamic view inside a maze, where walls, sprites, and other elements have distinct positions and appearances. The primary goal is to craft a realistic three-dimensional view in a two-dimensional maze, leveraging the MiniLibX library.

## Key Components

1. **Ray-Casting Technique**: The core of the project, ray-casting is a technique used to determine the visibility of surfaces, emulating a 3D perspective.

2. **Game Map Parsing**: Students are required to read and validate game maps from files, processing information about wall positions, player starting position, and more.

3. **Graphics Rendering**: Using the MiniLibX library to render the game environment, including walls, floors, ceilings, and sprites.

4. **Player Movements**: Implementing controls for the player to move and rotate within the maze, altering the visual perspective as necessary.

5. **Texture Mapping**: Applying textures to walls and objects to make the environment more lifelike.

6. **Sprite Rendering**: Incorporating interactive or static sprites into the environment, ensuring they are drawn to scale and positioned correctly relative to walls and the player.

7. **Error Handling**: Ensuring robust error handling to manage invalid maps, missing assets, or other potential game-related issues.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **Graphics Programming**: Dive deep into the intricacies of ray-casting and 3D rendering in a 2D environment, laying a foundation for more complex graphics projects.

2. **File Parsing**: Develop parsing skills, ensuring that game maps are read, validated, and processed correctly.

3. **Problem Solving**: The project poses various challenges, from rendering walls correctly based on player position to handling sprite overlap, all requiring analytical thinking.

4. **Texture Mapping**: Gain hands-on experience in mapping textures onto surfaces, essential for realism in graphics projects.

5. **User Input Handling**: Implement and manage user controls, allowing seamless navigation and interaction within the game environment.

6. **Optimization**: Achieving smooth rendering and movements necessitates efficient algorithms and resource management.

7. **Attention to Detail**: Given the precision required in graphics rendering, meticulous attention to detail becomes paramount.

8. **Basis of Game Development**: This project serves as an introduction to core game development concepts, such as game loops, rendering, and player interaction.
